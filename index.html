        <h2> About Juan </h2>
        
      <p> I grew up in the south side of Chicago and graduated from George Washington High School. </p>

      <p> I currently reside in the Albany Park neighborhood of Chicago with my boyfriend, our 5-year-old cat and 7-month-old puppy.</p>
     
    
      <p> After graduation, I entered the workforce, working in the food & service industry, bouncing from job to job. </p>
      

      <p> In my last job, I worked my way up to management. After a few years as a General Manager, I decided that I wanted something new. </p>
     

      <p> I decided to change my career path and focus on something I can enjoy doing. In 2019 my cousin sent me an introductory course to python and I remember thinking how easy i was able to understand the material. </p>
        
        <p>After a few months of research, I decided to study software engineering with <a href="http://thinkful.com">Thinkful</a>. I'm very excited to work with a team of developers! </p>
