        <h2> About Juan </h2>
        
      <p> I grew up in the south side of Chicago, and graduated from George Washington High School. </p>

      <p> I am currently living in the Albany Park neighborhood of Chicago with my boyfriend and our 5 year old cat and 7 month old puppy.</p>
     
    
      <p> After graduation, i entered the work force, mostly working in the food & service industry, bouncing from job to job. </p>
      

      <p> In my last job, i worked my way up to management. After a few years as a General Manager i decided that i wanted something new. </p>
     

      <p> I decided to change my career path and focus on something I can enjoy doing. I remembered learning a little bit about Python with my cousin and how easy it was for me to pick up. </p>
        
        <p>After a few months of research I decided to study software engineering with <a href="http://thinkful.com">Thinkful</a> and I'm very excited to work with a team of developers! </p>
